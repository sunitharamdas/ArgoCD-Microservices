# ArgoCD-Microservices
This project uses ArgoCD to manage and deploy a microservices architecture.
The setup includes a GraphQL API layer for efficient data querying and interaction, alongside dedicated services for managing orders and products. Each microservice is containerized, independently scalable, and deployable via ArgoCD to ensure seamless CI/CD workflows and efficient deployment management. The solution is designed to support high-availability, resilience, and scalability, making it suitable for handling dynamic e-commerce or inventory management environments."
