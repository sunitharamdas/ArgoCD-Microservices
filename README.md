# ArgoCD-Microservices
This project uses ArgoCD to manage and deploy a microservices architecture.
The setup includes a GraphQL API layer for efficient data querying and interaction, alongside dedicated services for managing orders and products.
Each service is independently defined as an ArgoCD Application.
